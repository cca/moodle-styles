<p><strong>Note for Internship Coordinators</strong>: these totals are <strong>only for hours entries visible in the table above</strong>, not for all hours entered in the tracker. The easiest method to determine a student's hours is to search for them by
    name (see the <strong>Search</strong> input above the list). You may also need to increase the number of <strong>Entries per page</strong>&nbsp;if a student has entered hours more than 10 times.</p>
