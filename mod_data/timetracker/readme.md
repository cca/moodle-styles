# Time Tracker

This db is a minimal "time tracker" app for our internships courses. Students can log their hours with an optional note, Internship Coordinators can search for students and see a total of their hours to determine if they're completed this requirement, and students can export a CSV of their hours to submit to their employer for sign off.

This is just an initial version based off of an example timetracker db we found online with a big overhaul of the JS and a CSV export feature added. There are likely other requirements we will need to incorporate.
